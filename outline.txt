	I'm just writing a program to do a lot of things with FASTQ files in order to learn python and to demonstrate knowledge of bioinformatic data formats. 
	
	For output options, you should be able to specify an output path, otherwise defaults to same place as the fastq files.
You should be doing everything with absolute paths so that the program can be run anywhere (as in, added to the $PATH variable). Finally, it'll be easiest to produce the reformatted (unwrapped, truncated entries removed) files regardless for running analysis of on plots, and then removing these if the user doesn't specify that they want reformatted entries.


	A) program to test to see if there are any malformed reads in the FASTA / FASTQ file! This tests for the following:
		1) The number of bases != the quality scores
		2) No bases
		3) missing 1 of the 4 lines
		4) truncated file (same as above but file ends there...)

	The program can then remove any of the reads that are malformed, if this is possible. Truncated files just return everything before the file was trunctated.

	B) Output summary statistics (Same as the program "FASTQC", basically, but make the graphs in python).


Above are legacy requirements. I'm not touching them for the moment, but adding the below as of January 11, 2023.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) If there are multiple input files and the -i flag is not specified, then only the cumulative graphs will be produced. 
2) If there is a single input file and the -i flag is not specificed, only the graphs for this single file will be produced
3) In the case of 2, the graphs will not be labelled as "All Files" but will labelled with their file name
4) If there are multiple input files and the -i flag is specified, then a graph for each file will be produced along with the cumulative graphs
